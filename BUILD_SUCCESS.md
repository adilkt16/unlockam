## üîß **Installation & Testing**

### **Step 1: Install APK**
```bash
# Connect your Android device or start emulator
adb devices

# Install the development build
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Launch the app
adb shell am start -n com.unlockam/.MainActivity
```

### **Step 2: Test the Production Alarm System**

1. **Navigate to Production Test Screen:**
   - Look for the "Production Alarm Test" section in the app
   - The UI includes system status, quick test buttons, and setup guidance

2. **Run Quick Test (30 seconds):**
   ```bash
   # Monitor logs while testing
   adb logcat -s ProductionAlarm:* ReactNativeJS:* | grep -E "(alarm|ProductionAlarm)"
   ```

3. **Run Doze Test (2 minutes):**
   - Schedule the 2-minute test alarm
   - Lock your device screen immediately
   - Wait for the alarm to trigger
   - Verify lockscreen UI appears and audio plays

### **Step 3: Monitor System Status**

```bash
# Check scheduled alarms
adb shell dumpsys alarm | grep com.unlockam

# Monitor wake locks
adb shell dumpsys power | grep ProductionAlarm

# Check foreground services
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep ProductionAlarmService

# Monitor audio focus
adb logcat -s AudioManager:* | grep ProductionAlarm
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### ‚úÖ **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] App installs and launches without errors
- [ ] Production alarm system loads and shows status
- [ ] All permissions are requested and handled properly
- [ ] 30-second test alarm rings with full volume
- [ ] Screen wakes up and stays on during alarm
- [ ] Lockscreen UI appears with dismiss/snooze buttons
- [ ] 2-minute test survives device lock and Doze mode
- [ ] Audio plays even if device volume is muted
- [ ] System shows appropriate OEM-specific guidance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **"Exact alarms not allowed" (Android 12+):**
   - App will automatically request SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission
   - Grant permission when prompted

2. **"Battery optimization enabled":**
   - App will guide you to disable battery optimization
   - Essential for reliable alarm triggering

3. **"Overlay permission denied":**
   - App will request SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission
   - Needed for lockscreen UI display

4. **"Alarm doesn't ring in Doze mode":**
   - Verify exact alarm permission is granted
   - Check battery optimization is disabled
   - Ensure foreground service is running

## üîç **Advanced Testing**

### **Force Doze Mode Testing:**
```bash
# Force device into Doze mode
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle force-idle

# Schedule alarm and verify it still triggers
# Then exit Doze mode
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle unforce
```

### **Permission Testing:**
```bash
# Test without notification permission
adb shell pm revoke com.unlockam android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS

# Test without overlay permission (alarm should still work)
adb shell pm revoke com.unlockam android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW

# Restore permissions
adb shell pm grant com.unlockam android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS
adb shell pm grant com.unlockam android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW
```

### **Audio System Testing:**
```bash
# Test with all volumes at 0
adb shell media volume --stream 3 --set 0  # Media
adb shell media volume --stream 2 --set 0  # Ringer  
adb shell media volume --stream 5 --set 0  # Notification

# Alarm should still play through alarm/ringtone stream
```

## üè≠ **Production Deployment**

When ready for production:

1. **Build Release APK:**
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

2. **Sign and Upload to Play Store**
3. **Test on Various OEM Devices** (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, etc.)

## üìû **Support & Debugging**

If issues occur:
1. Check `adb logcat -s ProductionAlarm:*` for detailed logs
2. Verify all permissions are granted in Android Settings
3. Disable battery optimization for the app
4. Ensure device isn't force-closing the app
5. Test on physical device (not just emulator)

**Your production alarm system is ready for comprehensive testing!** üöÄ
