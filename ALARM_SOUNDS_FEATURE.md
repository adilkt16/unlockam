# Alarm Sounds Feature

## Overview
Added multiple alarm sound options that users can select from the settings page.

## Features Added

### 1. Multiple Alarm Sound Types
- **Classic Beep**: Traditional alarm beeping pattern (default)
- **iPhone Style**: Distinctive tri-tone pattern similar to iPhone alarms
- **Gentle Wake**: Softer, rising tone for a gentler wake-up experience

### 2. Sound Selection in Settings
- New "Alarm Sound" section in Settings > Alarm Settings with improved vertical layout
- Radio button selection for each sound type
- Individual preview buttons integrated with each sound option
- Clean, modern card-based design with visual feedback
- Settings are automatically saved and persisted

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/utils/soundGenerator.ts`**
   - Added `ALARM_TYPES` constants
   - Enhanced `generateAlarmTone()` to support different sound types
   - Added `getAlarmTypeDisplayName()` and `getAllAlarmTypes()` utilities
   - Updated `createComplexAlarmTone()` to accept alarm type parameter

2. **`src/hooks/useAudio.ts`**
   - Added AsyncStorage integration to read selected alarm sound type
   - Updated `createAlarmTone()` to use selected sound type
   - Enhanced `testAlarmSound()` to preview specific sound types
   - Added proper TypeScript typing for timeout references

3. **`src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`**
   - Added alarm sound type state management
   - Created improved vertical layout with radio buttons
   - Integrated preview buttons for each sound option
   - Enhanced visual design with card-based layout
   - Integrated with AsyncStorage for persistence
   - Added comprehensive styling for modern UI elements

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Open Settings screen
2. Navigate to "Alarm Settings" section
3. Select desired alarm sound from "Alarm Sound" options
4. Test sounds using individual preview buttons
5. Save settings

### For Developers:
- Alarm sounds are automatically loaded based on user selection
- The `useAudio` hook handles all sound management
- Settings are persisted in AsyncStorage with key `alarmSoundType`
- Easy to add new sound types by extending `ALARM_TYPES` in `soundGenerator.ts`

## Future Enhancements
- Add custom sound file support
- Volume control for each sound type
- Sound scheduling (different sounds for different times)
- More sound variety (nature sounds, music clips, etc.)

## Recent Updates
- **v1.1**: Replaced "Digital Alert" with "iPhone Style" alarm sound that features a distinctive tri-tone pattern similar to iPhone alarms for better user familiarity and effectiveness.
- **v1.2**: **MAJOR UPDATE - Automatic Daily Recurring Alarms**
  - Eliminated the need to manually activate alarms every day
  - Alarms now automatically repeat daily once times are set
  - Only way to stop alarms is to explicitly disable them
  - Persistent alarm times that survive app restarts
  - Automatic rescheduling for the next day after alarm ends
  - New disable/enable alarm functionality in TimeSettingsCard
  - Enhanced user experience with "set once, works forever" approach

## Daily Alarm System (v1.2)

### Key Features:
1. **Automatic Activation**: When you set start and end times, the alarm automatically becomes active
2. **Daily Repetition**: Alarm repeats every day at the same time without user intervention
3. **Persistent Configuration**: Alarm times are saved and persist across app restarts
4. **Auto-Rescheduling**: After an alarm ends, it automatically schedules for the next day
5. **Manual Disable Only**: Alarms only stop when explicitly disabled by the user

### User Experience:
- **Set Times Once**: User sets their preferred alarm window (e.g., 6:30 AM - 7:30 AM)
- **Automatic Activation**: Alarm becomes active immediately and shows countdown
- **Daily Repetition**: Alarm rings every day at the specified time
- **No Daily Setup**: User never needs to activate the alarm again
- **Disable When Needed**: User can disable the alarm when they don't need it (vacations, weekends, etc.)
- **Easy Re-enable**: Changing alarm times automatically re-enables the alarm

### Technical Implementation:
- **Daily Alarm Configuration**: Stored in AsyncStorage with enabled/disabled state
- **Auto-Rescheduling Logic**: After alarm completion, automatically schedules next occurrence
- **Persistent Storage**: Alarm times and enabled state survive app restarts
- **Enhanced AlarmService**: New methods for daily alarm management
- **Improved UI**: Clear status indicators showing whether daily alarm is active or disabled
