# Permission Refresh Functionality Improvements

## What was fixed:

### 1. **Smart Refresh Logic**
- The regular refresh button now properly checks permissions without clearing manually set states
- Only clears "first-time check" flags to allow fresh evaluation
- Preserves user's manual permission overrides

### 2. **Deep Refresh for Problem Cases**
- **Long-press the refresh button** (1 second) for a "Deep Refresh"
- Clears ALL cached states and forces completely fresh evaluation
- Use this when permissions are showing incorrectly after changing them in device settings

### 3. **Enhanced Console Logging**
- Added detailed console logs to track permission checking process
- Easier to debug permission detection issues

### 4. **Improved Permission Detection**
- More conservative approach for system-level permissions
- Better handling of first-time vs returning user scenarios
- Smarter default values that encourage proper setup

## How to use:

### Regular Refresh:
1. **Tap the refresh button** in Settings or **pull down** in the Permission Dashboard
2. This checks permissions while preserving your manual settings
3. Good for normal use when returning from device settings

### Deep Refresh (for troubleshooting):
1. **Long-press the refresh button** (hold for 1 second)
2. Select "Deep Refresh" in the dialog
3. This completely clears all cached states and checks fresh
4. Use when permissions show wrong status after changing in device settings

## Expected behavior:

- **Turn off permission in device settings → tap refresh → should show "Not Granted"**
- **Turn on permission in device settings → long-press refresh → deep refresh → should show "Granted" (if detectable) or stay "Not Granted" (for manual verification)**
- **Manual overrides (long-press individual permissions) are preserved during regular refresh**
- **Pull-to-refresh works the same as tap refresh**

## Console output:
Check the console for detailed logs about permission checking process to help debug any issues.
